## Installation
### **Basic Installation**
- Completely delete the original `citizen` folder from your FiveM and move the present one in the package;
- Move the `a_CATUSSE_Package_VisualOptimisation_NG.rpf` file to the `%LocalAppData%\FiveM\FiveM.app\mods\` folder

### **Complementary Installation**
***Note: The following modifications are personal, and may have different performance on each computer, it is recommended that you back up your computer before running the files.***

- **Disable Power Throttling**: Creates a new power plan "forcing" your computer to run FiveM with maximum processing power;
- **Increase CPU Performance**: Activates game mode and sets games to run at maximum priority on your computer, overriding other programs;
- **Increase System Resposiveness**: Disables Moderate Network Speed ​​input so you can stop losing some packets (reduces PL) during gameplay;
- **KeyBoard Optimization**: Enables the Keyboard Class Driver in Windows 10, a kernel device driver capable of reducing the keyboard response time by a few milliseconds (if the computer uses > PS/2 inputs);
- **Mouse Optimization**: Enables the Mouse Class Driver in Windows 10, a kernel device driver capable of reducing mouse response time by a few milliseconds (if the computer uses PS/2 inputs);
